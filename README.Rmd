##  Introduction

This package contains `{tidyverse}`-like functions that I use often in projects.

## Installation

`devtools::install_github("tonyelhabr/tetidy")`.

## Notes

Here is a list of all functions in the package.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("tetidy")
ls("package:tetidy")
```


## Things To Do/Consider To Be More `{tidyverse}`-like

### In General

- Change all references of `col`s to `var`s.
- Should change all `_at` functions to be use `manip_at()` internal function,
as shown in `mutate_at()` and `summarise_at()` implementations in `{dplyr}`.
(See <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/2e6ca1676ece390b7a3e0a76b52c6bbf1464a180/R/colwise-mutate.R>.)
- Be opinionated about the prefixing of argument names with `.`. In general,
implement the take-aways from the discussion at
 https://community.rstudio.com/t/function-argument-naming-conventions-x-vs-x/7764/15
(discussion on `{tidyverse}` package function argument naming conventions).
(As explained in the 
[`{forcats}` 0.3.0  release notes](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/02/forcats-0-3-0/),
"Consistent with other tidyverse packages, all functions that take ... 
now use tidy dots. This means that you can use !!! to splice in a list of values."
Also, per Hadley's response at <https://github.com/tidyverse/style/issues/75>
"It is not a general principle. It's something that only apply to FP tools like 
purrr, because you don't want to confuse the arguments to map() with the 
arguments to .f".)


### With Specific Functions

- `pull_distinctly()`
    - [check] Use `.data` and `var` to match `dplyr::pull()` argument names exactly.
    
- `arrange_distinctly()`
    - [check] Use `.data` and `...` to match `dplyr::distinct()` argument names exactly.

- `rank_unique(x)`
    - Use `-xtfrm(x)` instead of `dplyr::row_number()` (which are equivalent)?

- `rank_arrange()`
    - Consider using `key` and `value` or `into` argument names (like `tidyr::gather()` and `tidyr::spread()`)
    (instead of `var` and `var_out`.
    - Keep `.data` argument name because it matches `dplyr::mutate`'s `.data`.
    - Consider "splicing" dots to pass to mutate (instead of "hard-coding" function used with `mutate()`.
    
- `count_arrange()`
    - Consider how `_at` form can better be combined with the non-suffixed form.

- `summarise_stats()`

- `join_fuzzily()`

- `summarise_join_stats()`

- `reorder_vars_at()`, `reorder_vars_at()`
    - If a major re-haul were to be done to implement `{dplyr}`-like handling of `_at` functions,
    then these would need to be updated.
