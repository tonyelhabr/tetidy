##  Introduction

This package contains functions that I use often in projects.

### Installation

`devtools::install_github("tonyelhabr/tetidy")`.

## Notes

### Inspiration

The original purpose of this package was to provide a convenient interface
to the `readr` and `rio` functions for importing and exporting data to various file formats.
Because I often found myself using the variable name as the name of the file,
I figured it would be nice to implement "lazy" methods for doing so.
Under the hood, this packages's functions use "Non-Standared Evaluation" (NSE)
(using techniques that may or may
not be up to date with the latest `tidyverse` methods of NSE `r emo::ji("smile")`).

Additionally, while implementing these `import`/`export` functions,
I realized a couple of other functions that I often
use in projects (e.g. `render_proj_io()` could be added.
(I don't necessarily recommend using these "other" functions, however, because they 
are tailored towards my use cases.)

```{r include = FALSE }
# sprintf("Code coverage: %f", covr::package_coverage())
```

### Syntax [^fn_readme]

[^fn_readme]:
The `fundManageR` package inspired some of the format of this section.
See its [README file](https://github.com/abresler/fundManageR/blob/master/readme.Rmd).

+ `import_ext*()` functions - Implement `rio`-like interface (note the use
of the verb "import") for reading data from files.
The main function is `import_ext()`, which requires that the file extension be specified with
the `ext` paramater. Shorcuts for the extensions that I find myself using most often
are implemented via the syntax `import_ext_[ext]()` (e.g. `import_ext_csv()`).
Under the hood, preference is given to `readr` methods if they exist and can be recognized.
(This is because it reads in `data.frame`s as `tibble`s by default.
Otherwise, an attempt is made to use a `rio` method (with subsequent coercion to a `tibble`).

+ `export_ext*()` functions - Counterpart to the `import_ext_*()` functions.
Notably, exporting of plots is supported. However, the support is not robust--
it is intended only for use with `ggplot2` plots, and only to the `png` file format.
The `units`, `width`, and `height` are set to package option values
(see `options("tetidy.ggsave.units"`, etc.)
if they are not all specified explicitly together.

+ `*_proj_io()` functions - "Meta" functions for an RStudio project.
`parse_proj_io()` attempts to create a `tibble` with
information regarding the input/output files in each script in an RStudio project.
The output could be used in a number of ways, such as in a node-dependency graph
visualizing how the project's files relate to one another.
`render_proj_io()` (a wrapper for `rmarkdwon::render()`) converts .R scripts
formatted with Roxygen2 style comments to .Rmd files. This is intended to be used
by users (like me) who prefer the "feel" of an R script when working with data that will
eventually be presented in a .Rmd file/report and don't want to work directly with
a .Rmd file. [^fn_r2rmd] __NOTE:__ These functions are fairly experimental and
should not be relied upon for anything that should be reliable.

+ `set_pkg_*_opts()` functions - Functions to facilitate setting this package's options
(This is preferable to calling `options()` directly,
which requires knowing exactly what the name of the option is).

[^fn_r2rmd]:
See [this blog post](http://brooksandrew.github.io/simpleblog/articles/render-reports-directly-from-R-scripts/) for more discussion.

Here is a list of all functions in the package.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library("tetidy")
# ls_vars_all <- ls("package:tetidy")
# ls_vars_ext_start <- grep("^import|^export", ls_vars_all, value = TRUE)
# ls_vars_ext_main <- grep("ext$", ls_vars_ext_start, value = TRUE)
# ls_vars_other <- setdiff(ls_vars_all, ls_vars_ext_start)
# ?tetidy::`tetidy-package`
# print(sort(c(ls_vars_io_main, ls_vars_other)))
ls("package:tetidy")
```


## Examples

Unfortunately, none (right now).
